               <p>Hellooo, guys.. Long time no i see you. So, today I will to tell you about my faith journey in my life. In this part, I will to tell you about my story. So, In this part, I also write in English languanges because I want used to learn English everyday. Let’s start the story ! [ Disclaimer : take from the true story in my life in God’s goodness. ]</p>
               <br>
               <p>The story will begin, when I was studied in College in Semarang, Central of Java in Indonesia. Before of it, I was lived in Jakarta with my Mother and my little brother in there. The distance between Semarang – Jakarta is almost 450 kilometres. That’s a God plan for I lived and growth in Semarang alone, but I’m not alone. I believe My God always stay with me everything situation.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Actually, It’s very hard to me for leave my family in Jakarta to move into another city or new places. I must live discipline and independent for take care of myself. Beside of that, I don’t have a friend in there when the start time of the class. One untill Six Months already passed, I very thankful to the God because he always protect and bless me.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Until once day, any something happened into my life. It’s make me feel the God’s goodness is biggest from everything. When around Mid-Semester Exam in 2013. At the time, I learn the Probability and Statistic Lesson for prepare to take this exam at 07.00 PM in my dormitory. I learn from my handbooks, my notes, and internet source for solved some question with several equation formulas. The time is still moving forward, I heard the song from Hillsong albums for praise the lord while studying.</p>
               <br>
               <p>When the time at 18.30 o’clock, I prepare to the classroom with drive my motorcycle. The distance between my dormitory into the class is not too far almost 9-10 kilometres. It just to take 5-10 minutes to arrived in there. Actually, my campus has located in tembalang hills. So, the streetway is not straight and flat, too many up and down ways to going there. In event, when the street is climb, I increased my speed of motorcycle. And the peak of the ways, I look some two girls in motorcycle too is already stopped in crossroads. I give a horn to notice their for I’m in high speed. I think the ways is clear and speed it up my motorcycle again.</p>
               <br>
               <p>But, that is in outside my expectations. When, I already near in the crossway, The girl’s motorcycle has moved to me. . . AND . . . I shout very hard to notice them. . . But, it’s not worked. Finally,. . . . .</p>
               <br>
               <p>BROOOG !!! BROGGGGGGG !!!</p>
               <br>
               <p>I have an accident. I already bounce into the aspalt with my motorcycle. Almost 8-10 metres from accident point I moved. I feel, I gonna died. My view is black like a sleep for several seconds. I wake up from the aspalt and I started to try turn on my motorcycle with crank the machine. Several times, I started to the crank, finally the motorcycle engine is life. When, I started to drive the motorcycle, the motorcycle is already broken. The steering wheel is not center with the wheels cause effect of crashed. The direction stering wheels go to the north, the wheels direction is face to the east. In this time, I feel very sad and disperated.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I try to calm and relax for facing this problems, because I’m not just thinking about my broken motorcycle, but the exam is my priority. I already promised into myself for dissappointing my parents for graduated in college with good grades. So, I try to cheers up for facing it and leave my motorcycle in Student Center Building, and stopped anybody has passed in front of me for take me into the class. Beside of that, I have a blamed with Campus Security because drive with high speed and make an accident to others. So, I’m not response him, because my mind is just thinking about exams.</p>
               <br>
               <p>The girl is brought to the hospital by security and passing driver, cause they don’t used helmet when drive the motorcycle. I think they have bleeding on their heads. My body also feel shaking, especially my left hand. I stopped stranger driver in the way to take me into the campus.</p>
               <br>
               <p>When I arrived into the class, I search where to location of my chair for exams in announcement board. I go to inside the classroom, and sitting in there. The lecturer has give the paper and question form to me. When I looks all the questions, I can’t think anything. My brain is blanks. My body is shaking repeatedly, especially my hand. I can’t wrote my name. I try to write my name in is very hard. So, I used my two hands for writing.</p>
               <br>
               <p>What I learn today, from morning until midnight is dissappeared and blanks. When I try hard to thinking, I remember this accident again in my mind. Until I pray to the God, “God please help me to answer this questions, I can’t think anything. . .!” So, I just fill the essay form with answer the questions. Because in this exam, the questions need solved with equation formulas. Effect of the accident, the formula is out of my mind and I answer with randomly.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Finally, the exam has done. At least 90 minutes for answer to take this exam. After the exam, I meet to my friend is Rian Adi Wirawan about my accident last minutes before the exam is started. He is helped me to take my broken motorcycle into dormitory. My motorcycle has serious problem and need critical service in workshop, beause the position between steering and wheels is not sync. So, the motorcycle must be drag and pull it to moved into my dormitory.</p>
               <br>
               <p>When I arrived into my dormitory, My body still shaking. Although, I try to calm and relax, it still shaking. When I closed my eyes, the accident showing up and happened in my imagination like a flashback. In this moment, when I was alone for facing this problem, I was cryed with praying to the God. I pray to the God, “why this situation must be happened to me. ! God, I’m sorry because my sin make you angry to me. . God, please help me ! I don’t have a enough money for repaired my broken motorcycle ! I just alone in here, nobody protect me exception is You.” I feel disperated and deep sad. I know maybe my exam result will get C or D points. My motorcycle has broken. So what should I do.</p>
               <br>
               <p>I can’t sleep and just only cry alone in my room. An hour later, The boarding mother knock my doors, and she asked me, “Do you have an accident ?”. I said “Yes”. So, she going to straight her house. After a minutes later, she knock my door’s room, and take me a medicine, foods, and a cup of hot tea. I very thankful so many people has attention to me. After her leaves my room. I cry very louder than before and saying thankful to God, because he always take care of me, although the God’s goodness happened by people in near me. God very kind to me. The name is Jesus Christ, the only name. He is The God and saviour in my life. I praise his name and saying thankful for this situation happened in my life. He is safe me from the accident.</p>
               <br>
               <p>It’s not just stopped in there, The God’s favor is still flowing in my life. After the accident, I always walking from my dormitory to the classroom. It takes 30-45 minutes for walking, so, I wake up always erlier than before. In the deepest of my heart I believe the miracles will be happened for those believe. So, I believe my motorcycle will be fixed and normal like as before.</p>
               <br>
               <p>In the last months, I dare myself to tell this situation to my parents, but my dad is actually scold me for this problem. And his needs I must be responsible for I have, you broke it you fixed it ! I very sad heard of it from my dad, but I believe always God’s way when I think all the way out. The faith is bring me to believe and cheers up everyday. I very thankful because from this accident, is not make my relationship with God to be break out, but opposite to be living in God’s way.</p>
               <br>
               <p>After 1-2 weeks ago, I’m reuniting with my high school teammates. Everyday we gather together for playing a games or just hang out together. Until at the time, my friend is Rizky tell that their friends has accident in the way to the campus at midnight. So, I feel any same situation with me. I try to take more information from him, Rizky tell that their friends is hospitalized because their friends have bleeding in their heads. And I tell to him that I also have accident in there. I don’t know, I believe it’s a God’s planned. God meet me with Rizky, because his want to show his miracles in my life. Rizky very shocked that have a crashed is me with their friends. Fyi guys, Rizky is the leader of Executive Student (BEM) in their faculty, including the important person in their faculty. Rizky promised to help and support me for this case.</p>
               <br>
               <p>The next week, I got call from Rizky, he talked to me to go to my dormitory with his friends. Around in 6.30 PM, they are come to my dormitory, almost 15-20 peoples come and want to check my motorcycle. They are take a photo of my broken motorcycle. Tomorrow, they are come again to my dormitory with Rizky bring envelope and give to me. He say very deep condolences for the situation happened and he tell also their friend is already recovered. The girls is also say apologize to me by Rizky. I very thankful and rejoice to Jesus Christ, because he lives I can face the problems so well.</p>
               <br>
               <p>After Rizky and friends leaves me, I opened the envelope and any 1,8 million rupiah in there. I just cry and can’t say anything, only thankful because God is good to me. I’m very happy, take my friends Ivan to helped me to bring my broken motorcycle to the workshop in this day. Because it has serious problem, the motorcycle must be hospitalized in workshop. In this position, I can’t know how many cost must be paid ! I just have the money from Rizky and friends, no more. . .</p>
               <br>
               <p>Finally, after 3 days, I go to the Yamaha workshop, to take my motorcycle. Before of it, I must pay the bill of repaired. I very shocked . . ! when I know that the total of the bills is same with the Rizky and friends give to me. Nothing more ! Nothing less ! everything is enough ! Jesus is very kind to me. I believe without God help, everything is impossible, No Miracles, Nothing happened. But for those believe, the Miracles is happened and declared. This is my story, how God has helped me. If you have a Faith in Jesus Christ, you can received the Miracles. That is not happened instant like as I have, needed a process. God need a process and build your character in Faith. If you believe, you can received in everything situation. Today, maybe the miracles what I have is not same with you or other people, God can make his way different from me from you and all people. <b>Still Believe, Living by Faith, Faith in Jesus Christ ! Jesus Bless you …</b></p>
